Hello!

In this project, I used React.js to apply my knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This project is a simple website that has an About, Home and Location section in the Navigation bar. The About tab gives information about me as a developer, The Home tab introduces the app to the user and the Location tab uses a REST api to get the current ISS (international space station) coordinates and maps it.

Technologies used: React.js, REST apis, Javascript, CSS, HTML
